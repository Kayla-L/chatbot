Assume that there are some numbers being added together and do the calculation.
1. first try to get this to work on just 2 numbers
2. once that is working, try for more than 2 numbers

Hints:
useful functions:
- float is a function that changes a string to a number so you can calculate in
  python
- split is a method of a string that breaks up a string into a list of strings
