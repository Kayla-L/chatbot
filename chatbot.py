Instructions:

0. Run the chatbot (there will be errors because there's missing code)
1. Fill in code for TODOs 1-5
2. Run the chatbot & get rid of all the errors, when you type "hi" into the
   prompt, the chatbot should respond, "Hello!"
3. Add 2 more intents (TODO 6)
4. Run the chatbot & get rid of all errors, get it to notice all 3 intents
5. Randomize response (TODO 7) and add responses to a greeting (TODO 8)
   HINT: use the library:
     import random
6. Run the chatbot & get rid of all errors, run multiple times to see it
   greet the user multiple ways
7. Modify the matching function (TODOs 9, 10, and optionally 11) to make the
   chatbot more likely to understand the user, even if they type things slightly
   differently than the pattern
8. Run the chatbot & get rid of all errors, see if it catches different versions
   of the user's utterances
9. Add an introduction (TODOs 12 & 13)
10. Run the chatbot & get rid of all errors
11. Modify the code so that the conversation ends when the user has the "goodbye" intent
12. Run the chatbot & get rid of all errors
13. Add riddles to the chatbot. (TODOs 14 & 15) Make a dictionary of all the riddles and answers
14. Run the chatbot & get rid of all errors 
15. (optional). Any other changes you want to make!
